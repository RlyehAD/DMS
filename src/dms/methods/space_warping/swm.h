 *This file should include ONLY the functions to be interfaced between DMS (CG phase) and GROMACS (MD phase)
 *It should contain all the necessary functions related to the space warping method.
 *In order to interface classes with C, a void CSpaceWarping pointer is created to handle
 *all the possible methods to be called in md.c

 *The SpaceWarping class changes the (micro) state from MD. Essentially, it advances the atomic positions
 *in time via a CG-guided evolution.
