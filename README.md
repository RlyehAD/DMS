               Welcome to the official version of DMS!

DMS (Deductive Multiscale Simulator) an open-source multiscale all-atom 
simulator that is based on the GROMACS molecular dynamics source code.

If you are familiar with Unix, it should be fairly trivial to compile and
install DMS since it uses both GROMACS and PETSc, and both packages are fairly 
supported on most architechtures. Similar to Gromacs, DMS uses only the CMake 
build sytem, and an installation guide can be found at
http://www.gromacs.org/Documentation/Installation_Instructions.

DMS is free software, distributed under the GNU General
Public License, version 2.1. DMS uses a substantial portion of the source
code of the molecular dynamics package GROMACS. If you want to distribute 
a modified version or use part of DMS in your own program, remember that 
the entire project must be licensed according to the requirements of the LGPL 
v2.1 license under which you received this copy of DMS. We request that it 
must clearly be labeled as derived work. It should not use the name 
"official DMS", and make sure support questions are directed to you instead 
of the DMS developers.

The development of DMS is mainly funded by academic research grants. 
To help us fund development, we humbly ask that you cite the DMS papers:
